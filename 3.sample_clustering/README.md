### Aim \& Purpose

All the scripts used in the manuscript were deposited here for several purposes and aims.

1. To demenstrate the reliability and reproducibility of the results.  
2. Making the codes fully accessible to researcher doing relavant researches
3. Looking forward to valuable suggestions and useful upgrades
4. Finding someone who has interests in similar studies (ngs, viral QS, viral hepatitis).



### Code architecture

Basically three folders corespond to three parts of the whole data manipulation and calculation procedure.

1. **NGS raw data pre-processing**

   From fastq reads  to viral haplotype quantification [view](./1.data_preprocessing)

2. **Machine learning model construction and evaluation**

   From viral quantification to clinical diagnostic models [view](./2.model_construction)

3. **Hierarchical clustering, principle components analysis and K-means classification**

   From viral quantification to clinical phenotypes [view](3.sample_clustering)
